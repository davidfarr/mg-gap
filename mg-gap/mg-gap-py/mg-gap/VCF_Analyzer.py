Class VCF_Analyzer

Description: Reads the VCF. Create a list of SNP's with their info
in a method and return the "list" of SNPs back to the main program file.

Editing thoughts for later: this class contains only one method.
No fields exist for this class when it is instantiated. Perhaps 
move method to the main program.py file as a method outside of main?
